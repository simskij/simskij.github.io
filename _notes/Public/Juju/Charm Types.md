### Machine Charms
For machines, two types of charms are available, namely [[Principal Charms]] and [[Subordinate Charms]]. 

These charms may be implemented either as [[Operator Charms]], [[Reactive Charms]], or [[Legacy Charms]], where a clear preference is given to operator charms.
### Kubernetes Charms
For Kubernetes, two paradigms exist, namely [[Sidecar Charms]] and [[PodSpec Charms]], where the second one has been deprecated.
