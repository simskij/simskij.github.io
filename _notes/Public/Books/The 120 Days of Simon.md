The 120 days of Simon is a book by the Swedish comedian, comic-book author and musician [[Simon GÃ¤rdenfors]]. The book is a autobiography of a trip Simon made where he stayed at different strangers houses for 120 days without sleeping at the same place more than once.

The story is funny, vulgar and tasteless, making it a hilarious must-read for everyone into alternative comics.
