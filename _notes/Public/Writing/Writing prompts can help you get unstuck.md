title: Writing prompts can help you get unstuck
---
It's easy to get stuck while writing, especially when what you're writing has to live up to some kind of quality bar, self-imposed or otherwise. A technique I see a lot to get unstuck again is to use so called *writing prompts*.

A writing prompt can take many forms. Sometimes it's a question that you're supposed to answer, forcing you to start from somewhere. Sometimes it might be a sentence or an entire paragraph that you're supposed to use as the basis for what you are writing.  A somewhat unhelpful, but classic, literary prompt is "Once upon a time".
