title: What I look for in a kitchen knife
---

Although I've added a couple of really nice knives to my collection since, I still am really picky with knives and prefer bespoke traditional knives over [[Global Knives]] and the like.

Things I value in a knife:

- A good, wooden, shaft that is comfortable even after an hour or two of non-stop cooking.
- Proper balance, with the center of gravity resting in the blade, a centimeter or so away from the shaft
- A sharp edge that **stays** sharp with occasional touch-ups, if  used as intended
