title: Getting into kitchen knives
---
When getting into kitchen knives, you really only need one knife, the 18cm chefs knife, although you'll likely want to buy more.

Some people recommend getting the a slightly larger knife, like the 22 or 24cm, because of their ability to carve meat really thin, but the nimbleness and speed of the 18cm makes up for this in most other aspects.
