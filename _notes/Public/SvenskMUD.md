SvenskMUD is a Swedish text-based RPG, or [[MUD]], originally founded by [[Linus Tolke]] in 1991. For many years, the MUD was hosted by the student group [[Lysator]] at [[Linköpings Universitet]]. The MUD is currently hosted in the cloud at Digital Ocean and is available to play at [telnet://svenskmud.com:2046](telnet://svenskmud.com:2046). 

There is also a discord server available where a lot of the players and admins hang out. Details on how to join this server is available at the bulletin board in [[Äventyrsgillet]] in [[Muddevalla]].
