Cloud computing is the practice of taking on-premise workloads and moving them to a managed self-service data center. These data centers could either be a public cloud, or an internal self-hosted private cloud using something like [[OpenStack]].

The [[Cloud Offerings]] might look different depending on which public cloud provider you are utilising, but most have two things in common:

- The hardware, and sometimes even the OS:s, is abstracted away from the consumer.
- Resources are metered and billing occur on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Most cloud providers also offer some kind of service as [[Infrastructure as a Service]], like [[Virtual Machines]] or even dedicated hardware.
