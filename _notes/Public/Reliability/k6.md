k6 is the name of a reliability testing tool originally created by a company with the same name, but now part of [[Grafana Labs]]. I worked at k6 from January 2020 to October 2021 as the Head of Developer Relations.

### The Tool
The tool itself is mainly built for performance and reliability testing, and is written in Go. It is open-source and free to use by anyone. In addition to the open-source offering, the company k6 also offers a fully managed cloud service called [[k6 Cloud]]. 

One of the main things that differentiates the tool from others in the same category is the fact that it's blazingly fast. Being written in go, a compiled language created with concurrency in mind, it is able to churn out high volumes of concurrent virtual users on modest hardware. 

Another differentiating quality that I personally really like is that it is code-based, while most competing tools either are configured in a declarative way, using for instance YAML, or GUI-based.
