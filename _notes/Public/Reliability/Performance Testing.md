title: Performance Testing
---
Performance testing is an activity part of the broader discipline [[Performance Engineering]].  Executing successful performance tests on a piece of software is usually a quite involved exercise, as it requires quite deep knowledge of what makes a system behave a certain way. 

Between [[2020-01]] and [[2021-10]] I worked at [[k6]] where I got to work on simplifying, and increase the value of, performance testing on a daily basis.
