  - Observability Telemetry Types

Observability is in general considered to concern itself with three types of telemetry, being [[Logs]], [[Metrics]], and [[Traces]].  Some even refer to these types as [[The three pillars of Observability]].

However, these three no longer suffice to describe the type of telemetry data used as part of a mature observability stack. In addition to these three standard telemetry types, we should also consider [[Events]] and [[Profiles]].
