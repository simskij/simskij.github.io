title: Chaos Monkey
---


Chaos Monkey was the first publicly available chaos engineering tool, released by [[Netflix]] who also coined the term. It has (or at least had) a tight dependency on Spinnaker, making it impractical to use for most engineering teams.

The term has to some extent become a moniker for fault injection agents used in chaos engineering, despite not being that popular a choice anymore.
