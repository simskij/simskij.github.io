Software Engineering is a term used to describe the practice of creating software.

While it commonly refers to the practice of writing code, it can in a broader sense be used to describe all practices involved in creating and running a piece of software, including [[Software Testing]], [[Software Maintenance]], [[Software Operations]] and [[Product Management]].

### Topics
- [[Software Architecture]]

### Thoughts
- [[Extendable software allows you to incubate new features without adding them to the core]]
- [[The open-source movement is shifting costs from license fees to operational costs]]

#### Programming Languages
A programming language is a system of notation used to instruct a computer into performing certain operations. These instructions, when put into sequence, make up a computer program, that in turn can be part of a piece of software.

Programming languages I either have proficiency or interest in, includes but is not limited to:

- [[JavaScript]]
- [[TypeScript]]
- [[Go]]
- [[Python]]
- [[Java]] ðŸ¤®
- [[C-Sharp]]
- [[6502 Assembly]]
