C# (C Sharp) is a reflective programming language, which when built is compiled into IL code.  It's a fun, fast and effective programming language, although not as performant and easy to use as [[Go|Go]].

For many years, the use of C# outside of Windows was, mildly put, clunky. Since around 2016, the situation has been gradually improved with native support for other platforms.
