title: JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. It powers almost all DOM interactions within a browser while browsing the web.  The core language has since been standardized by the ECMA TC39 committee, under the name [[EcmaScript]].

The language was, according to legend, initially created in only ten days to add web page interactivity to a early demo build of Netscape. Whether this is true or not can be discussed.
