title: Webpack
---


Webpack is an open-source tool for bundling, packing, and processing, javascript files. I've used it extensively on most JS projects I've been part of since 2016, and it's been a very nice experience compared to it's predecessors [[Gulp]] and [[Grunt]].

### Alternatives

Lately, a bunch of contendors have started to gain some momentum, primarilly [[Rollup]] and [[Parcel]], but in all the projects I've tried them so far, I've ultimately ended up switching back to Webpack for various reasons.
