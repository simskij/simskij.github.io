title: Kubernetes is a container orchestration system, but that's not the point
---

The usage of containers is an implementation detail and not the main point. Instead, think of it as a [[Distributed Operating System]] trying to schedule work and utilize resources in the best possible way.

[This article](https://nikhiljha.com/posts/kubernetes-intro/) by Nikhil Jha contains a fairly standard walkthrough of the Kubernetes architecture. However, it also contains a **really** good explanation of what Kubernetes is and how it differs from [[Docker]].

> Notice how my definition of Kubernetes doesn't include the word "container". This is on purpose. The main idea behind Kubernetes is declarative infrastructure management, not running containers.

## Key Ideas
- [[Kubernetes is not Docker]]
- [[Kubernetes is best thought of as an operating system]]

## Further Lines of Inquiry
- [[Kubernetes Operators]]
- [[Kubernetes Autopilot]]
