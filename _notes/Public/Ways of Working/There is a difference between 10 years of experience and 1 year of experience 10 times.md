### Anecdotal Evidence

When I started learning SQL during the late 00's, I attended a class  [[Cornerstone]] in preparation for a MSSQL Certification exam. One of my *classmates* had been a DBA for 20 years, mainly working with oracle databases. 

During this time, they had never written a single line of SQL. Their responsibilities had always been to move databases between different servers using the GUI, and nothing more. - 1 year of experience, 20 times.
