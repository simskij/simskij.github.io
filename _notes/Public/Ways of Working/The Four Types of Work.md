title: The Four Types of Work
---
In [[The Phoenix Project]], a case is made for there only being four different types of work in IT. The four types are:

- [[Business Projects]]
- [[Internal IT Projects]]
- [[Change Requests]]
- [[Unplanned Work]]

Further, [[Gene Kim]] suggests that the fourth kind, unplanned work, is worthless and only serves as an obstacle for the other three types to get done.
