title: Encouraging experimentation by getting rid of blame
---

Blame creates fear, which in turn makes people less prone to risk and experimentation. In a company culture where we want to encourage reasonable risk taking and continuous experimentation, we must make sure that our post mortems are blame free, and focuses on learning from incidents rather than pointing fingers.

### Post Mortems
- Asking what and how over who and why
- Be transparent. Meaning that we need to be factual and to the point about what transpired - no velvet gloves.
