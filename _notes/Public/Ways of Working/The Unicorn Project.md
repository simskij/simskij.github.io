The Unicorn Project is [[Gene Kim]]'s second novel, describing the events that transpired in [[The Phoenix Project]], but instead told from the angle of [[Maxine]], a senior software developer at Parts Unlimited.

While a good book with many good take-aways, it's literary style is a lot more forced than The Phoenix Project, making it a less inspiring read.
