title: Engineering MANAGER vs ENGINEERING manager
---
The idea of being an **engineering** manager, in contrast to being an engineering **manager**, emphasises the benefits of staying a practicing engineer even while moving into management.

If you, as an engineering manager, don't keep practicing and honing your engineering skills, they will inevitably start to deteriorate. [[Charity Majors]] proposes in her article [[Engineering Management - The pendulum of the ladder]] that the deterioration process takes about 3-5 years.
