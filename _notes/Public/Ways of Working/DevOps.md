title: DevOps
---



A methodology popular in tech companies where software development practices and ideas are applied to IT Operation as well. Further, the method encourages cross-functional teams that are able to take full responsibility of all parts of the [[Software Development Lifecycle]]. Similar to [[Lean]] in both scope and approach. Became extremely popular through books like the [[The Phoenix Project]].

There are likely about as many definitions of DevOps as there are practitioners. In contrast to many of these ideas, I firmly believe that DevOps has very little to do with [[Technology]], and instead almost exclusively deals with how we work together, what work we prioritize, and the culture we create while doing it. In short, it's a set of principles, or a way of working, that aims to allow teams to deliver high-quality software while minimizing lead time.
