A great business novel in the [[DevOps]] space. Not as good as [[The Goal]], but a great runner-up for second place. The novel is more about operations than development, but still provide a lot of really valuable lessons for companies moving towards DevOps-oriented practices.

For a more development-oriented take on the same subject matter, see [[Rolling Rocks Downhill]] or [[The Unicorn Project]].
