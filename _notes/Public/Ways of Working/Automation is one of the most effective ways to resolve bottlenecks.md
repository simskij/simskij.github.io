title: Automation is one of the most effective ways to resolve bottlenecks
---
The biggest time saving you can do is by making sure you don't have to do anything at all. By [[Automating everything that can be automated]], you free up your own time to work on the things that can not. If you **can** automate a task, you probably should. 

### Motivations
- [[Automation is cheap. Manual labor is not]]
- [[Automation scales. Manual labor does not]]
- [[Machines are more reliable than humans]]
