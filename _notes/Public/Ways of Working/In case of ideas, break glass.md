title: In case of ideas, break glass
---
Promote ideation and experimentation by providing easy access to resources.

The idea was that, somewhere in the office, there would be idea emergency kits, including  prepaid debit cards, post-its, pens and other stationary that could be of use when trying out an idea or project.

Any employee was allowed to go get one of these kits if they wanted to explore an idea for company growth. They then got to use the content of the kit to trial their idea and see whether it could be fruitful for the company.

This was done as an attempt to promote creativity and experimentation, and while sounding a little bit corny, at least hits the right spot in terms of its intent.
