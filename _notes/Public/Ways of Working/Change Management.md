title: Change Management
---

*Change Management* describes the processes and practices needed to perform a change in a tech environment. These processes often include conditions and approvals needed, serving as checkpoints and tollgates.

The idea originates from [[ITIL]], which for a long time was the favored way of practicing [[IT Operations]].

Traditionally, organizations that do change management also implement change advisory boards (or CABs) as tollgates, where each change may get approval for execution in production. For a change to be considered by the board, one would first have to file a [[Change Requests]].

In my experience, [[Change Advisory Boards are useless]]. It seems like the industry is catching on as well, given how stark the contrast is when practicing [[DevOps]].
