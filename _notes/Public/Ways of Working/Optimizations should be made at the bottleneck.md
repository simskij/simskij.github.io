title: Optimizations should be made at the bottleneck
---

Any improvement made to a system that is not made at the bottleneck will be without effect until the bottleneck itself has been resolved.  In other words, the biggest constraint dictates the throughput of the entire system. 

This idea originates from [[The Theory of Constraint]], which also describes a simple process for resolving bottlenecks and optimizing whole systems. 

This idea has been described in great detail in both [[The Phoenix Project]] and [[The Goal]].
