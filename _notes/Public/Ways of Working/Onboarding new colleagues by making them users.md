title: Onboarding new colleagues by making them users
---
Onboarding new colleagues gives us a rare opportunity to get detailed feedback about what we're doing from someone with no stake in (or knowledge about) the decisions made up until that point.

At [[k6]], this feedback was generated by letting every colleague go through what was called a [[Week of Testing]].  They got to use the product for a week, with the expectation of learning how it works and that they would provide honest feedback about their experience. 

Once completed, they were expected to present their findings at a bi-weekly tech call.
