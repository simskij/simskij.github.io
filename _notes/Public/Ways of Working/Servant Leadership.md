Servant Leadership is a term refering to the management technique where you instead of making and enforcing decisions, lead by serving, enabling and facilitating the decisions of the team.

This idea is very popular in modern management litterature and has in recent years become almost a clich√© on professional networking sites like LinkedIn.

Everyone claims to practice it, but how many actually do?
