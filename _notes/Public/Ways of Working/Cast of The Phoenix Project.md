### Bill Palmer

The protagonist of the story. Starts out as a well-respected manager of the mid-range technology department. Is coerced, or rather forced, by [[#Steve Masters]] into accepting the role as the companies new VP of IT Operations.

### Steve Masters

The CEO, and acting CIO, of Parts Unlimited.

### Maggie Lee

Senior Director of Retail Program Management. Runs the project office. Only peripherally involved, but cheers on the changes of [[#Bill Palmer]] and his team.

### Patty McKee

Director of IT Service Support. Change Manager. Reports to [[#Bill Palmer]].

### Sarah Moulton

SVP of Retail Operations and a real careerist trying to climb the corporate ladder by undermining everyone else. Quits in the end after a bad play of hands. Reports to [[#Steve Masters]]

### Wes Davis

Director of Distributed Technology Operations. Rough around the edges and don't really play by the corporate norms. Hot-headed and lacks a verbal filter. Mostly funny but would probably be quite frustrating to work with in real life. Reports to [[#Bill Palmer]]

### Chris Allers

VP of Application Development. Starts out as somewhat of a nemesis, due to his very empirical approach to work, which, by judging from past performance, paints IT as a real underachiever. 

Once [[#Bill Palmer]] and team gets the ball rolling however, he comes around and proves to be a really valuable ally.

### Eric

[[#Bill Palmer]]'s mentor, who introduces him to the work of [[Eliyahu M Goldratt]], and how IT and software development really isn't that far from plant management, or any other kind of work. 

Clearly an adaptation of Alex's mentor Jonah from [[The Goal]].

### John

Chief Information Security Officer. For the first half of the book he's totally oblivious as to what the business needs are, and acts from a totally disconnected, unrealistic point of view, only building obstacles for the rest of the company to get past. 

Comes around after a thorough scolding by [[#Eric]] and becomes one of [[#Bill Palmer]]'s most important allies.
