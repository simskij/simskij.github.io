title: Snaps
---

Snaps are a way of distributing software in a self-contained and isolated fashion on [[Linux]]. It utilises the same core mechanics as [[Containers]] for doing this, namely [[Linux CGroups]]. The snap ecosystem consists of multiple components:

- [[Snapd]]
- [[Snapcraft]]
- [[The Snapstore]]
- [[The Snap CLI]]

While snaps, and subsequently snapd, are available in multiple Linux distributions, the most battle-tested and hardened implementation is likely in [[Ubuntu]].
