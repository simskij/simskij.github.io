        Hi, my name is Simme!
    </div>
    <div class="home-sub-text">
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer, open-source aficionado and engineering manager from Sweden.
            I've spent most of my career building performant and reliable systems and teams.
            Every now and then, I also do some public speaking. In 2021, I became a Docker Captain,
            which I then followed up in 2022 by also becoming a Google Developer Expert in the Cloud
            and Modern Architecture category.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, you'll find some of the things I write around community building, open-source,
            leadership, observability, and site-reliability engineering. If you'd like to read my raw notes,
            they're available here and get updated as I explore new topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time, you'll usually find me either out and about in the forest with the dogs,
            skiing, doing gardening, or playing with my Commodore 64.
